# ‚ùì About
- Rapid Claimer is a lightning fast and easy-to-use ubisoft name claimer, account checker and name swapper. Follow the steps below to get started with using it!

# üîé Name Claimer Usage
**1.** If you have proxies, add them to the data/name_checker.proxies.txt file
<br>

**2.** Go to data/name_checker/names.txt and paste the names you want to check
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ Each name on a new line
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ To quickly generate 3/4 letter names visit http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/random-string-generator/
<br>

**3.** Open rapid.exe and select option 3, the token generator
<br>

**4.** Next enter how many tokens you want to generate
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ I suggest generating 100+ tokens, without proxies you will be ratelimited after 7 tokens
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ You can see these newly generated tokens in the data/name_checker/tokens.txt file
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ Using Existing Accounts will generate tokens with accounts in data/tokens/token_accounts.txt
<br>

**5.** Close the program and re-open it then select option 1, the name claimer
<br>

**6.** Select how many threads you want to use
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ I suggest 1-100
<br>

**7.** Done! You're now checking for available names and will claim them if they are available
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ The name claimer is proxyless at 1-2 threads, anything higher requires proxies
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ Available names will appear in data/name_checker/available.txt
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‚Ü≥ Claimed names will appear in data/name_checker/claimed.txt
